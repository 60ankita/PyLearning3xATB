# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# The = operator assigns a value to a variable.
# The == operator compares two values and returns True if they are equal, False otherwise.



# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# ** is the exponentiation operator.
# example :-
# print(2 ** 3) # 2 to the power of 3 = 8



# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
# The XOR operation can be used for different purposes; XOR of two integers, XOR of two booleans, Swapping two numbers using XOR, etc.

# Initializing two integers a and b
a = 15
b = 32

# Finding XOR of a and b using ^ operator
c = a ^ b

# Printing the XOR value
print(a, "XOR", b, "=", c)
